## Introduction to Test Automation Frameworks

A test automation framework is a structured setup of tools, libraries, and best practices that facilitate the automation of repetitive tests. The key benefits of using an automation framework include:

- **Consistency and Reusability**: Provides a consistent structure and allows for reusable components.
- **Maintainability**: Simplifies the process of making changes and updates.
- **Scalability**: Can grow as the application evolves.
- **Reporting and Debugging**: Built-in logging and reporting features aid in quick issue identification.

## Tools Used

This framework utilizes the following tools:

- **Python**: A versatile programming language known for its readability and community support.
- **Selenium**: A powerful tool for automating web browsers and simulating user actions.
- **pytest**: A testing framework that makes it easy to write simple and scalable test cases.

## Framework Structure

The test automation framework is organized into the following main components:

1. **configData**: Stores configuration and data files necessary for tests.
2. **pages**: Implements the Page Object Model (POM), encapsulating elements and actions for each page.
3. **testcases**: Contains organized test cases for each page/module.
4. **utilities**: Includes helper functions for tasks such as reading element configuration files.
5. **report**: Houses Allure report output files for viewing test results.
6. **requirements.txt**: Lists Python package dependencies needed for the project.

## Directory Structure

The directory structure of the framework is as follows:

```plaintext

## Running Tests

To run the tests, follow these steps:

1. Install the required packages using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Execute the tests with pytest:
   ```bash
   pytest testcases/
   ```

The Allure report can be generated after running the tests for better visualization of results.
